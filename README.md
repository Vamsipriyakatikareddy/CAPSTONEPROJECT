# Dynamic Parking Pricing System  
Capstone Project ‚Äì Summer Analytics 2025
---
## Overview
Urban parking lots often suffer from inefficient pricing ‚Äî leading to either overcrowding or underutilization.  
This project implements a real-time dynamic pricing engine for urban parking spaces using Pathway for data streaming and Bokeh for real-time visualization.
Built as part of the Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone hosted by the Consulting & Analytics Club.

##  Model Implemented
### Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing
A simple model where prices increase linearly with occupancy:
Price = 10 + 10 √ó (Occupancy / Capacity)
‚úîSmooth and explainable price changes  
‚úîReal-time updates with a 2-hour tumbling window  
‚úîPricing varies from $10 to $20 based on demand
